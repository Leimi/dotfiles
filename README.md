These are config files I share across my archlinux machines for several applications:

* oh my zsh with a home made theme
* awesome wm
* dunst
* gtk-3.0
* lxsession
* sublime text 3, with home made snippets
* xmodmap: using an azerty layout on a qwerty keyboard, so setting the 105th key on the caps lock modifier
* common bash scripts: easily add things to the path, start a server, toggle my thinkpad touchpad.

The repo is structured as if it was my home directory, so you can copy and paste stuff directly or create the symlinks with the given script.
If using the create-symlinks script, be sure to change paths accordingly.
