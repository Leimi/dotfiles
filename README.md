These are config files I share across my lubuntu machines for several applications:

* cairo dock
* xfce4 panel
* lxde / openbox: slightly modified AcidBox theme + keyboard shortcuts to easily access common apps and switch between virtual desktops.
* pytyle: custom shortcuts, basically remapping everything with the `super` modifier instead of `alt`
* oh my zsh: home made theme and bash aliases compatible with zsh
* sublime text 3: lots of plugins, custom keyboard shortcuts and settings
* xmodmap: using an azerty layout on a qwerty keyboard, so setting the 105th key on the caps lock modifier
* common bash scripts: easily add things to the path, start a server, toggle my thinkpad touchpad.

You can try those easily by setting the correct symlinks - look at the `create-symlinks.sh` script.
