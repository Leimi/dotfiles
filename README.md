These are config files I share across my lubuntu machines for several applications:

* lxde / openbox: slightly modified Numix gtk theme + keyboard shortcuts to easily access common apps and switch between virtual desktops.
* pytyle: custom shortcuts, basically remapping everything with the `super` modifier instead of `alt`
* oh my zsh: home made theme and bash aliases compatible with zsh
* xfce4 panel
* sublime text 3: lots of plugins, custom keyboard shortcuts and settings
* xmodmap: using an azerty layout on a qwerty keyboard, so setting the 105th key on the caps lock modifier
* cairo dock
* common bash scripts: easily add things to the path, start a server, toggle my thinkpad touchpad.

The repo is structured as if it was my home directory, so you can copy and paste stuff directly or create the symlinks with the given script.
